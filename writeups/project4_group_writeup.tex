\section{Design}
Based upon the literature in Chapter 12. Memory Management of the textbook \textit{Linux Kernel Development, 3rd Edition}, Linux Kernel developer blogs and websites, and the descriptive information in comments within the \texttt{/mm/slob.c} file, we updated the \texttt{slob.c} file to use the best-fit algorithm as opposed to the first-fit algorithm for SLAB block allocation.

To implement the SLAB best-fit algorithm, we had to first understand the first-fit algorithm that was currently in-use for SLOB allocations. The first-fit implementation searches through the list of available pages, locates the first page with enough free space to accomodate the requested space, and then searches within that page for the first available block to allocate. Our best-fit implementation contrasts this by searching through the list of available pages, locates the first page with enough free space to accommodate the requested space, and then searches within that page for the block with the closest amount of free space to the requested space, and then it allocates the space.

    Since the slob\_page\_alloc() function controls the search within a page, and the logic for the first-fit algorithm occurs within it, we modified this function to allow for the best-fit algorithm instead. Within that function, instead of immediately allocating at the first available block, we moved all relevant allocation code to run only at the end of the loop, after a best-fit block is found. When that available block is found, we have a secondary check to see if the difference is smaller than the previous best difference. This will result in having the best difference at completion of the loop. The saved best variables are prev, cur, aligned, delta, and the difference.

As in our previous assignments, we maintained our team choice of using Git and GitHub as our version control platform. We updated the \texttt{mm/slob.c} file with our best-fit SLAB allocator code.

With the best-fit SLOB allocator updated, we followed the standard steps for compiling, building, and linking together the Linux Kernel, as illustrated below:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Set the kernel configuration options:\\\\
		\texttt{make menuconfig}\\\\
	The options for setting the SLAB allocator are available in \texttt{General setup} ${}\rightarrow{}$ \texttt{Choose SLAB allocator}. However, the SLOB option has been hidden and must be enabled by enabling the \texttt{General setup} ${}\rightarrow{}$ \texttt{Configure standard kernel features (expert users)} option. After that option is set, return to \texttt{Choose SLAB allocator} and select \texttt{SLOB (Simple Allocator)}.
		
	\item Compile the main kernel:\\\\
		\texttt{make -j8}
	\item Compile the kernel modules:\\\\
		\texttt{make modules}
	\item Install the kernel modules:\\\\
		\texttt{make modules\_install}
	\item Install the new kernel on the system:\\\\
		\texttt{make install}
\end{enumerate}

Using a clean Linux Kernel 3.0.4 source tree, we attempted to get the kernel built and loaded with the SLAB allocator set to use the SLOB algorithm. The first time we ran through the compile and build proces, though, we received the following errors upon running the \texttt{make install} command:\\

\texttt{[root@localhost linux]\# make -j8\\
\indent\indent CHK \indent include/linux/version.h\\
\indent\indent CHK \indent include/generated/utsrelease.h\\
\indent\indent CALL\indent scripts/checksyscalls.sh\\
\indent\indent CHK \indent include/generated/compile.h\\
\indent\indent CHK \indent mm/slob.c\\
\indent mm/slob.c: In function `slob\_page\_alloc':\\
\indent mm/slob.c:292: error: `best\_fit' undeclared (first use in this function)\\
\indent mm/slob.c:292: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once\\
\indent mm/slob.c:292: error: for each function it appears in.)\\
\indent make[1]: *** [mm/slob.o] Error 1\\
\indent make: *** [mm] Error 2\\
\indent make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....}\\

This issue was resolved by locating the error (\texttt{mm/slob.c:292}) and fixing the incorrectly labeled variable; \texttt{best\_fit} should have been \texttt{best\_diff}.

Once the Linux Kernel successfully compiled and loaded, we rebooted and selected the updated kernel at the Grub boot menu. We then compiled our \texttt{test.c} file so that we could validate that (1) the SLOB allocator was functioning correctly, (2) that it was providing timings and usage statistics, and (3) that those statistics were in-line with the assumption that SLOB requires significant overhead and performance reductions compared to the SLAB or SLUB algorithms.
		
\section{Version Control Log}

The following version control log details all changes that were made to add the RAM Disk device driver, with CryptAPI enabled, to the Linux Kernel 3.0.4 source tree, and allow for the loading and unloading of this module during runtime:\\
